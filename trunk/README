You will need MWRap to install the MATLAB interfaces: http://www.cims.nyu.edu/~dbindel/mwrap/
You will need O2scl to handle the geometry/solver calculations: http://sourceforge.net/projects/o2scl/
You will need BOOST for the numerical linear algebra

Edit the make.inc file to your needs before typing make all at the command line
